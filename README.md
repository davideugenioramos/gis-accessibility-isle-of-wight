# GIS Accessibility Analysis – Isle of Wight (UK)

## Overview
This project evaluates spatial accessibility to physical banking services across the Isle of Wight using ArcGIS Pro. The analysis integrates network-based modelling, buffer comparison and raster processing techniques.

## GIS Methods Applied

### Service Area Analysis
Used network-based service area modelling to calculate realistic travel accessibility to bank branches.

### Network Analysis
Applied transport network datasets to model route-based accessibility patterns.

### Buffer Analysis
Generated Euclidean buffers to compare straight-line accessibility with network-based results.

### Raster Processing
Used raster techniques to assess spatial variability in accessibility and broadband suitability.

## Data Sources
- UK Government Open Data
- ONS Population Data
- Broadband Infrastructure Data
- Banking Branch Locations (public dataset)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced GIS modelling
- Network-based spatial analysis
- Raster processing
- Policy-oriented spatial assessment
